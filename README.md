# SimpleWriter

SimpleWriter is the official Substance starter example. It sets up a minimal environment for Substance editor development. Fork this code and create your own editor.

Read the [tutorial](http://substance.io/docs/beta5/your-first-editor.html).

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/substance/simple-writer.git
```

Note that by default you will see the development version. Be aware that
you may encounter bugs. If you want to work on the latest release version,
please check out the master branch.

```bash
git checkout master
```

Now install dependencies and start the dev environment.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:5555`.
